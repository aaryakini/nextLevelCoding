		<p>I am from the little tropical island of Singapore! Fun fact, at 18 hours and 40 mins long, the Singapore Airlines flight from New York to Singapore is the longest flight in the world, and I take it every time I go back to visit my family and friends!</p>

		<p>I love love love reading! Usually my favourite genre to read is world history — Sapiens has to be my favourite book of all time, it completely changed my perception of the world and my place in it. But recently, a friend put me on to Normal People by Sally Rooney and that has me on a fiction binge. I am currently reading Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie.</p>

		<img class="tooltipImage" src="assets/kathak.jpg">
		<p>I have been learning the Indian classical dance form of Kathak since I was 7 years old. I got my Diploma in the dance form in 2020 and since then I have continued to learn, teach, and perform. I was really killing it on the local classical dance scene back in Singapore but I had to take a break once I moved to NYC for school since I wasn't able to find a studio to practice in.

		<p>My favourite flower is Arabian Jasmine. It is a species native to tropical Asia, from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia. During festivals, Indian women put jasmine flowers in their hair. So the smell of these flowers reminds me of my mother and brings a very warm, nostalgic feeling to my heart.</p>

		<img class="tooltipImage" src="assets/trettmann.jpg">
		<p>One of my favourite genres of music is German rap. I think it sounds so different to English music, and has such a great vibe! Perfect to get work done to since I can't really keep up with the lyrics so I don't get distracted, but it still has such an energetic feel to it! Listen to my playlist <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5WBw4jtReQnYPhKazvaJsU?si=f3bb09bf82fe47b7">here</a>!</p>

	<div class="tooltipframe display" id="food">
		<img class="tooltipImage" src="assets/keeMao.jpeg">
		<p>My favourite cuisine is Thai food. So perfectly flavourful and delicious. I particularly like Massaman curry and Pad Kee Mao. In my opinion, the best Thai restaurant around is Thai Villa on 5 E 19th St. Check it out if you have the time!</p>

	<div class="tooltipframe display" id="chai">
		<img class="tooltipImage" src="assets/chai.jpeg">
		<p>One of my greatest skills is making the perfect cup of chai. I grind the spices myself in a lil' mortar and pestle to make the perfect flavourful blend. I personally like to use peppercorns, cardamom, cloves, and an inch or so of ginger along with loose leaf black tea, whole or almond milk, and a little bit of brown sugar. Hit me up if you'd ever like to try! I'm a strong believer in the community building power of chai, so I'm always happy to make you a cup :) <3</p>

		<p>I'm totally convinced that sports were one of humankind's most futile inventions, yet still I really love watching them. I personally like Formula One and football (soooo excited for the World Cup this year!), but I keep up with tennis for my mother.</p>

		<p>Apart from CD, I am also majoring in Journalism! I really like writing features and am particularly drawn to community-centric, research-based pieces. Hands down, the best journalism class at The New School is Fake News, Free Speech, and Democracy in South East Asia taught by Anjali Khosla. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1galytqF4OHJ6kPTWpm9Dwn7vO_J62rk8ft7TfU6oJ04/edit?usp=sharing">Here's</a> a piece I wrote from that class!</p>
